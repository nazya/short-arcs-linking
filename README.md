*Linking short arcs reseach framework*

## Description
This framework was developed as a part of my master diploma. It allows to simulate near-Earth object motion and can be a foundation for closely related projects. 

The  aim of the project was a development of an algorithm of estimation near-Earth object orbit based on two short optical track extracted on different observation session. It was shown, that this problem can be reduced to 2D non-convex optimization problem. But later i was developed an improvement alowing to reduce non-convex optimization problem to quasi-convex optimization problem. Now one can learn how the algorithm works with different parameters of observation sessions.

Unfortunately, there is no related theory in english.  But there is a intention to remove this fault.

## Thanks
I express my gratitude to Nicholay Andrianov for giving implementation of numerical orbit integration algorithm.
